# AI Eye Prognosticator
#### A Computer Vision based software that uses YOLOv3 Object detection algorithm to detect objects like Cars, Motorcycles & Humans from CCTV footage. The detections are stored in a database and further used by Machine Learning model to predict future population count, human density in an area. 

# Features
* Social distancing 
* Count Incoming & Outgoing cars
* Track human path
* Detect humans & count them
* Store stats of incoming & outgoing people
* Predict future incoming & outgoing people
* Predict most populated place
