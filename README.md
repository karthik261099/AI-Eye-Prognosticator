# AI Eye Prognosticator
#### A Computer Vision based software that uses YOLOv3 Object detection algorithm to detect objects like Cars, Motorcycles & Humans from CCTV footage. The detections are stored in a database and further used by Machine Learning model to predict future population count, human density in an area. 

# Features
* Social distancing 
* Count Incoming & Outgoing cars
* Track human path
* Detect humans & count them
* Store stats of incoming & outgoing people
* Predict future incoming & outgoing people
* Predict most populated place

# Notes & Future Scope
### Video parameters to collect
1. Timestamp of entering
2. Timestamp of exiting
3. Date & Day
4. Total screentime (more when a person stood at a place)
5. Direction of motion
6. Moving path - line or zigzag

### Features
1. Detect humans & count them
2. Store stats of incoming & outgoing people
3. Predict future incoming & outgoing people count
4. Detect face/cloths & track the path of a person
5. Predict the most populated place
6. Analyse the density of people count
7. Detect human face & get the old purchase history in a shop
8. Detect vehicle & note its number plate/Colour
9. In a mall predict which shop has the most customers, Which type of shop has more customers, Which part of the mall has the most customers
10. Detect which vehicle broke the signal
11. Vehicle number plate detection
12. Social distancing
13. Mask detection
14. Parking space availability
